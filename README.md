# c-and-cpp
# This repository contains all the assignments for the course Programming in C and C++ offered at Jacobs University. These assignments work with fundamental # imperative programming concepts like variables, assignments, loops, and function calls. They also include basic data structures such as multidimensional 
# arrays, linked-lists, queues, and stacks. Pointers are also introduced and dynamically allocated multidimensional arrays and linked lists and trees are  
# used for solving simple practical problems. Recursive functions are also relevant, along with file handling and memory allocation. The specified topics 
# are all covered in C. Assignments 9-13 cover basic concepts of object-programming languages using C++ in a hands-on-manner. Classes and objects, data 
# abstractions, and information hiding are all introduced. C++ mechanisms for defining and using objects, methods, and operators are also introduced and 
# used. Of relevance as well are constructors, copy constructors, and destructors for dynamically created objects. Lastly, concepts such as inheritance, 
# polymorphism, virtual functions, and overloading are also introduced.
