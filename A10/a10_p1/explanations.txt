a) Commenting out the 'using namespues std;' gave me the following errors:
    1. unknown type name 'string'; 
    2. use of undeclared identifier 'cout';
    3. use of undeclared identifier 'endl';
    4. use of undeclared identifier 'cin';
    
    These errors mean that I am not specifying the namespace std, which would 
    mean I could simply type lines like 'cout << "Hello world." << endl;' and 
    the compiler would know where to get the definitions for functions such as 
    cout, cin, endl, and the class string . The simplest way to correct these errors is to include
    the statement 'using namespace std;'. If this statement is not used, then 
    this means I have to specify the namespace for every outide object, variable...
    This means I need to use the namespace name and scope resolution operator ::
    before the names of anything I need from std, i.e:
    'std::cout << "Hello world." << std::endl;'
    'std::string s;'
    'std::cin >> s;'
    
b) Removing the Critter:: prefix from the method 'void Critter::setName(string& newname)' 
gave me the following error:
    1. use of undeclared identifier 'name'

    This error is pointing out that I have not sepcified the class from which 'name'
    is defined. The reason why I have to include the prefix Critter:: before every method
    is because other classes may have the same properties, so the compiler needs to know 
    in which class to look to get the right 'name' type.
